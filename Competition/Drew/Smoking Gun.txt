Current competition plan
--------------------------

Programming:
Expected V5 Shipment is after our first competition,
use ROBOTC during that time; while we're doing this 
I will still port code over to C++ so the transition
will be easier later.

Robot:
Piston is main scoring device, connected to the elevator.
The elevator sends to piston, which is connected to a feeder wheel.
The feeder wheel should be very fast, so a low gear ratio.
(Most likely will be 6:1 when V5 motors ship)
Using 393's now but the transistion to only 8 V5 motors will NEED
redesign of the robot, lots of gears and Y's required!
